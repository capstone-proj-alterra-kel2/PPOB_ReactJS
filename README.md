# Payment Point Online Bank

### Project Goal

"Payment Point Online Bank" or abbreviated as PPOB is a real-time online bill payment service available 24/7, enabling faster, accurate, and secure data and fund reconciliation processes.

### Project Scope

In this project, PPOB is still in the form of a mobile app for end users and a website for administrators. PPOB is focused on the B2C market, so it will directly interact with users. In this material, you are tasked with creating product transactions according to your key points or discussions. Therefore, we have divided the users as follows:

1. End Users:
   End users are the users who use the application on the mobile platform. They can register, perform transactions, and view the transaction history.

2. Admin:
   The super admin is a user who manages all accounts and data. The admin in the PPOB system can also manipulate products and transactions.
